### About this project: ###

*I stored data in mongodb database, made some routes with nav components, shared components, private/protected route. It is a service-related application. There are 6 services that anyone can take, and can review those services. 

*I used CRUD operation to read, create, update and delete data from/to database. 

*I implemented 2 kinds of authentication systems: email & password sign in, google sign in, as well as register. I also used authContext and firebase.

*I made some private/protected routes. If user is not logged in, they cannot get certain services and they cannot see and post their reviews.

*I used react-photo-view to see the picture in full screen when anyone clicks it.

*I used mongodb, vercel and firebase for hosting front and backend.
